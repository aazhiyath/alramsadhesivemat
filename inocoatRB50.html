                    <h1>INOCOAT RB-50 (Latex Modified Bitumen Emulsion)</h1>
                    <p>
                        Inocoat RB 50 is an emulsified bituminous coating modified with 10% Styrene Butadiene Rubber, which
                        dries to form a tough and seamless, flexible water and vapor proof protective coating<BR>CHARACTERISTICS: 
                            Cold applied.
                            Single component, easy to apply.
                            Can be applied on damp substances.
                            Dual advantage of curing as well as protection of concrete.
                            Asbestos free, odorless. Can be applied in closed or confined spaces.
                            Water -based and therefore is non-toxic.
                            Environmentally friendly.
                            Good resistance against chloride and sulphate ions.
                            Has good adhesion to most building substrates.
                            Seamless/ joint free.<br>FIELDS OF APPLICATION:
                            Can be used for a wide variety of application, which includes the following:
                            Waterproofing & protective coating on concrete foundations.
                            As a curing compound on freshly cast concrete structures.
                            As damp proof membrane in sandwich construction.
                            Waterproofing in wet areas such as toilets, kitchen etc.
                            General vapor proof coating for both interior and exterior floors and walls.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Instruction for use</h4>
                    <p>
                        Application procedures may vary slightly depending upon site condition. The general recommended
                        guideline for application of the bitumen coating system is as follows:
                        Surface preparation
                        The surface shall be cleaned thoroughly of all contaminants like dust, traces of curing compound, oil,
                        grease. Light mechanical grinding/ grit blasting/ high pressure water jet may be used to clean the
                        surface of the contaminants on the degree of contamination on the surface to be coated.
                        All surface imperfection and protrusion shall be removed and repaired. Structurally unsound and friable
                        concrete must be removed and repaired with a suitable concrete repair mortar.
                    </p>
                    <p> <span>Coverage :</span> Approximately 1-1.7 m&sup2;/ltr per coat subject to the type of surface being coated.</p> 
                   <p><span>Storage :</span> Store in a cool place and keep away from all sources of heat and direct sunlight.</p> 
                    <p><span>Shelf Life :</span> 12 month from the date of manufacture in original packing, if stored properly.</p>
                    <p><span>Packing :</span> 250 kg DRUM.</p>
